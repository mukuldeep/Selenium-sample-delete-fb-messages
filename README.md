# Automate deletion of facebook messages

I was cleaning up my facebook messanger, had to delete thousands of conversations and FB allows to delete one conversation at a time.
Deleting facebook conversation one by one!! It's a boring task. So, I wrote a program that will delete conversation for me automatically.
At first, I thought to create a chrome extension that will delete facebook conversations in background, but after a little reseach, I found it's irrelevent as they were not capable of handling dynamically created hashes. So, I choose SELEIUM with FIREFOX to do the same for me.

*capable of deleting thousands of facebook conversation per hour, efficiency depends on network speed.
